- *Generics*

Linked list implementation using generics.

- *Runner*

Allows to schedule sequential tasks to run concurrently,
while also monitoring specified time boundary and OS interrupt signal.
link:https://github.com/mskalbania/go-examples/blob/76bd8d661e07089faf47b87d2b407b86cd02ae9a/runner/runner.go#L20[runner.go]

- *Pool*

Manages a resources that can be shared by multiple goroutines (like db connections).
Resource must implement io.Closer interface.
Doesn't restrict the size but aims to maintain the specified targetSize - grows when required, shrinks when above targetSize.

- *Work*

Allows concurrent processing of work by multiple go routines.
Backed by an unbuffered channel.
Guarantees that work is scheduled to some worker, exchange (send/receive) must happen between goroutine.
This is a different approach than a based pool backed by a buffered channel.
